# Terminal Scripts

### ec2

> A script to simplify the process of SSHing into an AWS EC2 instance. It automates the command by storing the key path and instance details, so I donâ€™t have to type them out manually every time.

### opn

> This script shortens the keystrokes needed to open scripts in Visual Studio Code. Instead of typing out the full path, I can simply provide the name of the desired script, and the command handles the rest. A convenient way to quickly tweak my scripts.

### treecat

> A script that combines the functionality of the native tree and cat commands. While not the most practical script, it has its moments of utility when exploring directory structures and their file contents.
